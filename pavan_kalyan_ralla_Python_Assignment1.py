1.Explain one key difference in Python installation on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
A.Windows → Python is not preinstalled. You must download it from python.org or use the Microsoft Store.
           During installation, you also need to check "Add Python to PATH" manually.
Mac → macOS comes with an older version of Python 2.x preinstalled (mainly for system tools).
           You usually install a newer Python 3.x version via Homebrew or python.org.
Linux → Most Linux distros already have Python 3 preinstalled and integrated into the system.
           You can install/update it easily via your package manager (apt, dnf, etc.)
